# R2L Wireframe

This project was done by Team R2L.

## What is it

The project is a wireframe for a calendar or todo app. We created a prototype style wireframe using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The Purpose

This project was made with the intention of creating a wireframe for an app.

The app is a calendar and todo app implemented with access to D2L api.  
This would allow for a user to have class events or due dates automatically added to their calendar and allow for them to add their own events as well.
